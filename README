The BeagleBone Breakout provides easy access to the BeagleBone components and test points during troubleshooting processes. BeagleBone’s are great with its stackability. However, when it comes to troubleshooting, some test points and components on the top side of BeagleBone are not reachable due to the stacking capes. The BeagleBone Breakout cape solves this problem by separating BeagleBone and its cape. There are two cutouts on the breakout cape, and each cutout is equipped with a set of two 46-pin connectors. The BeagleBone is connected to the male pins of one set, where the capes will stack on top of the other.
